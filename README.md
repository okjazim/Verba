# Verba
Verba is a community-driven, open-source language learning application designed to make language education accessible to everyone. The app is completely free, with no advertisements, subscriptions, or paywalls, and is built to work offline by default.

Developed with Flutter, Verba uses transparent, easy-to-edit lesson formats that allow developers, educators, and language learners to contribute new languages and improve existing content. The project focuses on practical vocabulary, real-world usage, and clarity over aggressive gamification or artificial limitations.
